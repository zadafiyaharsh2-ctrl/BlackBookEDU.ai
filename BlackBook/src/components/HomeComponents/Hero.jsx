          <span className="font-bold">BlackBook AI Tutor</span> is a gamified
          learning app designed to make JEE/NEET preparation smarter and more
          engaging. Instead of solving problems from static books, the app gives
          you progressive levels of questions â€” starting easy and moving to
          advanced as you improve. The AI continuously tracks your performance,
          identifying strengths and weak spots.
          <br />
          Think of it as a problem-solving game where every correct answer takes
          you closer to mastering JEE/NEET.
